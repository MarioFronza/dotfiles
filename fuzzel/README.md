# fuzzel

Application launcher, bound to `$mod+space` in [`../sway/config`](../sway/config)
(replaces `wmenu-run`, which still ships with archinstall's Sway
profile but isn't used). `fuzzel` itself is installed via
[`../packages/`](../packages/README.md).

Colors are [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) (Night
variant: `#7aa2f7` accent, `#c0caf5` text, `#1a1b26` background) — same
font as the rest of the setup.

## Copy

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/fuzzel
cp fuzzel/fuzzel.ini ~/.config/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini
```

## Apply

Takes effect the next time fuzzel is launched — no reload needed.
